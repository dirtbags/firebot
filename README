IRC Bot Framework
=================

I recommend you check example.py and modify it to your needs.

The irc framework encapsulates all messages with a sender and forum.
For messages to a channel, the forum is the channel, and the sender is
the nickname who sent it.
For private messages, the forum and sender are both the nickname who sent
it.

The idea here is that you can write a bot that responds to the forum,
and it will go to the right place.
